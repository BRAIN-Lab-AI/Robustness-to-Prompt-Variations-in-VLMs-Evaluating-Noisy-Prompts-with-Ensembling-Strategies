## Problem Statement
Vision Language Model are models that integrate visual and textual modalities to perform tasks and enabling sophisticated applications like visual question answering, image captioning, and visual reasoning [1]. 

Recent advances in VLM includes Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Context Optimization (CoOp) models. CLIP is a zero-shot vision–language model learns to match images with text rather than rely only on class name. It turns an image into a vector of numbers and a text prompt into another vector, then checks how similar those vectors are. This makes the model relies on prompt templates like “a photo of a {}.” instead of simply using a class name in image classification tasks. Which makes the model very sensitive to the structure of prompt templates [2]. To mitigate this limitation, a CoOp has proposed, which is a few-shot prompt learning method that replaces CLIP’s hand-crafted prompts with learnable tokens optimized for specific tasks [3].CoOp  shows high performance with correctly crafted prompts compared to CLIP.

## Project Technicalities

### Terminologies
- **Diffusion Model:** A generative model that progressively transforms random noise into coherent data.
- **Latent Space:** A compressed, abstract representation of data where complex features are captured.
- **UNet Architecture:** A neural network with an encoder-decoder structure featuring skip connections for better feature preservation.
- **Text Encoder:** A model that converts text into numerical embeddings for downstream tasks.
- **Perceptual Loss:** A loss function that measures high-level differences between images, emphasizing perceptual similarity.
- **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) for processing.
- **Noise Vector:** A randomly generated vector used to initialize the diffusion process in generative models.
- **Decoder:** A network component that transforms latent representations back into image space.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The process of gradually improving the quality of generated data through multiple steps.
- **Conditional Generation:** The process where outputs are generated based on auxiliary inputs, such as textual descriptions.

### Problem Statements
- **Problem 1:** Achieving high-resolution and detailed images using conventional diffusion models remains challenging.
- **Problem 2:** Existing models suffer from slow inference times during the image generation process.
- **Problem 3:** There is limited capability in performing style transfer and generating diverse artistic variations.

### Loopholes or Research Areas
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Lack of robust metrics to effectively assess the quality of generated images.
- **Output Consistency:** Inconsistencies in output quality when scaling the model to higher resolutions.
- **Computational Resources:** Training requires significant GPU compute resources, which may not be readily accessible.

### Problem vs. Ideation: Proposed 3 Ideas to Solve the Problems
1. **Optimized Architecture:** Redesign the model architecture to improve efficiency and balance image quality with faster inference.
2. **Advanced Loss Functions:** Integrate novel loss functions (e.g., perceptual loss) to better capture artistic nuances and structural details.
3. **Enhanced Data Augmentation:** Implement sophisticated data augmentation strategies to improve the model’s robustness and reduce overfitting.

### Proposed Solution: Code-Based Implementation
This repository provides an implementation of the enhanced stable diffusion model using PyTorch. The solution includes:

- **Modified UNet Architecture:** Incorporates residual connections and efficient convolutional blocks.
- **Novel Loss Functions:** Combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) with perceptual loss to enhance feature learning.
- **Optimized Training Loop:** Reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.

### Key Components
- **`model.py`**: Contains the modified UNet architecture and other model components.
- **`train.py`**: Script to handle the training process with configurable parameters.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for data processing, augmentation, and metric evaluations.
- **`inference.py`**: Script for generating images using the trained model.

## Model Workflow
The workflow of the Enhanced Stable Diffusion model is designed to translate textual descriptions into high-quality artistic images through a multi-step diffusion process:

1. **Input:**
   - **Text Prompt:** The model takes a text prompt (e.g., "A surreal landscape with mountains and rivers") as the primary input.
   - **Tokenization:** The text prompt is tokenized and processed through a text encoder (such as a CLIP model) to obtain meaningful embeddings.
   - **Latent Noise:** A random latent noise vector is generated to initialize the diffusion process, which is then conditioned on the text embeddings.

2. **Diffusion Process:**
   - **Iterative Refinement:** The conditioned latent vector is fed into a modified UNet architecture. The model iteratively refines this vector by reversing a diffusion process, gradually reducing noise while preserving the text-conditioned features.
   - **Intermediate States:** At each step, intermediate latent representations are produced that increasingly capture the structure and details dictated by the text prompt.

3. **Output:**
   - **Decoding:** The final refined latent representation is passed through a decoder (often part of a Variational Autoencoder setup) to generate the final image.
   - **Generated Image:** The output is a synthesized image that visually represents the input text prompt, complete with artistic style and detail.
